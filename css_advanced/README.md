📘 ALX HTML & CSS Project

This project is part of my ALX Software Engineering journey, focusing on HTML and CSS fundamentals. The goal is to build a simple, functional, and accessible website while learning how browsers render pages and how CSS brings structure and styling to life.

🚀 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I should be able to explain the following concepts clearly — without the help of Google:

🌐 General

What is CSS and why it is essential in web development

How to add style to an element using inline, internal, and external CSS

What is a class in CSS and how it can be reused across multiple elements

What is a selector and how it targets elements in the DOM

How to compute CSS specificity value and resolve style conflicts

What are Box properties in CSS (margin, border, padding, and content)

How the browser loads a webpage and applies HTML/CSS step by step

📑 Requirements

✅ All files must end with a new line

✅ A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder

✅ No external libraries (No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)

✅ The website must be built only with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

✅ All code should be W3C compliant and validated with the W3C Validator

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – for structure

CSS3 – for styling (selectors, classes, box model, responsiveness)

JavaScript (optional, vanilla) – for interactivity if needed
